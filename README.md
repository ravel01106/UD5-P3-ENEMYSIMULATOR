## **Purpose of the project:**

This project aims to recreate a simulation of an old game genre. In this game, the user will interact with the console, will choose a weapon and an armor and will recreate a combat between the user against some random mobs from the Minecraft game.

## **Interface segregation principle:**

This project meets the Interface segregation principle because the users or clients only need to know the methods which they are going to use and not which ones they will not use. So, in this case, all the small interfaces that make sense inside the code and there is not method which is not used.
